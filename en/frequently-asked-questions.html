	LuxuryHotelCompany offers over 200 hotel packages, which are all different and may consist of 1, 2 or 3 nights complemented by for instance breakfast, dinner, bicycle rental, free use of wellness facilities and many other options. De composition of these extras is determined together with the hotel.</p>
<p>
	The advantage you receive is based on averages, calculated over an entire year. So during the peak or low season, your advantage could deviate from that average. This means that sometimes your advantage will be much larger than indicated on www.luxuryhotelcompany.com, while at other times it could be a little less. This depends on the different rates the relevant hotel charges during the course of the year.</p>

	When you fill out the booking form, there is a schedule to the right that lists arrivals and departures. It shows the availability of the hotels for the next three months.&nbsp;The bookings made on our website are always on the request, the hotel can still refuse the bookings.</p>

	It is not possible to view all affiliated hotels without a voucher. You have to log in to <a href="http://www.luxuryhotelcompany.com/default.aspx?la=1">www.luxuryhotelcompany.com</a>. You can, however, view a number of recommended package deal examples at www.lhcv.nl. The hotels listed are comparable to the ones affiliated with us.</p>

	You cannot stay at hotels without a companion. All package deals are put together for two people. Without a companion, you are not eligible for the discount.</p>

                                <p>
	You can contact us to cancel your booking. You can mail or call us, and we will contact the hotel and send you a confirmation of the annulment. Depending on the cancellation policy of the hotel cancellation fees can be charged.</p>

                                <p>
	The first person pays the package price and booking price when checking in, as specified on the website. When you hand in your signed voucher, your companion stays for free. There is no restitution or other compensation for package deals under EUR185. If the theme package deal for the hotel of your choice costs less than EUR185, the lower sum is the total worth of your companion&rsquo;s LuxuryHotelGiftVoucher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	An example: your chosen accommodation offers a theme package deal worth EUR154 for three nights. You pay EUR154 and your companion hands in the LuxuryHotelGiftVoucher for his or her free stay. The total worth of the LuxuryHotelGiftVoucher for this reservation is EUR154. EUR185 minus EUR154 is EUR31. You will not receive the difference of EUR31. When you book a package deal for EUR185, the total discount for your companion is EUR185 as well.</p>

                                <p>
	The first person pays the package price and booking price when checking in, as specified on the website. When you hand in your signed voucher, your companion stays for free. Instead of paying the total sum of the package deal, for example EUR370, you only pay half with the voucher.</p>
